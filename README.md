### Hi, I'm Henry! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  

I enjoy [learning new things](https://henrlly.com/blog/course-reviews), building new projects and doing competitive programming.  
Previously, I used to do Capture-The-Flags (CTFs) and Hackathons.  

I also write a [blog](https://henrlly.com/blog).
